# Skyrim Mods

An attempt to catalog any of my old scripts and mods for skyrim (see oldrim) as well as version control any new modding I do for Skyrim SE.

It's not worth me spending a lot of time cleaning it up, so most of my old stuff is in unsorted, grouped in with a bunch of misc scripts or mod ideas that I abandoned (like having and raising kids).
